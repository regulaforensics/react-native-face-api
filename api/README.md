## How to build the demo application
1. Download or the clone current repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/regulaforensics/react-native-face-api.git`.
2. Run the following commands within the root directory:
```bash
$ cd example
$ npm install
$ cd ios
$ pod install
```

**Note**: make sure that Metro Bundler is running when you run your app. Otherwise, run `npx react-native start` command. If it fails to start, run `git init` from Project root, then `npx react-native start`.

3. Android:
  * Run `npx react-native run-android` inside `example` folder - this is just one way to run the app. You can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

**Note**: if the running failed with the following error `Error: spawn ./gradlew EACCES`, try to run the following command `chmod +x gradlew` within the `example/android` directory.

4. iOS:
  * Run `npx react-native run-ios` inside `example` folder - this is just one way to run the app. You can also run it directly from within Xcode.
